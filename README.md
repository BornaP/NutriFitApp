# NutriFitApp
Example of MVC windows forms application. Built as a part of student assignment.

Application was built as a course assignment on "Object-oriented Design". The main goal was to apply theoretical knowledge of object-oriented design and create small, but optimal, domain model and to implement Model-View-Controller Pattern. 

Therefore, all calculations in application are truly fictious and arbitrary. Do not take them seriously.

Additionally, I implemented Observer design pattern so that every change made by adding or deleting entries is automatically updated in all related views.
